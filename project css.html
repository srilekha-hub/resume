    <h1><mark>PRIVACY PRESERVING KEYWORD BASED INTEGRITY AUDITING FOR CLOUD DATA ENCRYPTION</mark></h1>
    <P>The Public Cloud Data Integrity Auditing Technique is used to check the integrity of cloud data through the Thitd Party Auditor(TPA).
       In our proposed scheme,the TPA who is only provided with the encrypted keyword,can audit the integrity of all encrypted cloud files that contain the user's interested keyword.meanwhile,the TPA cannot deduce the sensitive information about which files contain the keyword and how many files contain this keyword.These sailent features are realized by leveraing a newly proposed Relation Authentication Label(RAL).
       The RAL cannot only authenticate the relation that files contain queried keyword ,but also be used to generate the auditing proof without sensitive information exposure.
       In this there are four modules ,They are Data owner,cloud server,TPA,Data user.Overall,this RAL scheme has the potential to enhance data security and privacy in cloud computing environments.
    </P>
